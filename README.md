Overview

This document is a comprehensive overview of the AI agent project, detailing its design, implementation, challenges faced, and potential future enhancements. The agent is designed to automate and streamline getting resume suggestions tailored to a job description.
AI Agent Flow Diagram
Below is a conceptual flow diagram illustrating the various stages and interactions within the AI agent's workflow.

Building the Agent

What approach did you take to design your agent?
My approach to designing this AI agent focused on a modular and iterative process. I tried to leverage n8n docs and videos to orchestrate the various components, including the AI model, and data parsing 
The core logic involved:
Receiving input data from form (trigger)

Pre-processing the data to extract relevant information.
Sending the processed data to the AI model for analysis and generation of structured output.
Parsing the AI's response, validating its structure, and extracting key fields.
Using the extracted information to trigger subsequent actions, such as sending a formatted email.

What challenges did you face in parsing, formatting, or integrating?
Several challenges were encountered during the parsing, formatting, and integration phases:
Inconsistent Input Data: Initial inputs often varied in format and completeness, requiring extensive data cleaning and normalization before feeding to the AI. 
AI Model Output Variability: While the AI was prompted to return JSON, there were instances where it deviated from the exact schema 
API Rate Limits: Integrating with external APIs I hit a rate limit that caused workflow failures. 
Complex JSON Structures: When the AI was required to generate deeply nested or complex JSON, ensuring the integrity of the structure during parsing was challenging. 


How did you ensure that the AI returned JSON reliably?

To ensure the AI returned JSON reliably, I tried to use:
Clear and Specific Prompts: The AI prompt was meticulously crafted to explicitly instruct the model to return output in JSON format, including a precise schema definition. 
Iterative Prompt Refinement: Continuous monitoring of AI outputs and iterative refinement of the prompt based on observed inconsistencies significantly improved reliability over time.
Troubleshooting
What issues did you encounter and how did you resolve them?
Parsing the raw data:

Configuration of email node.

Optimization

What might you improve or add in future iterations?
Future iterations of this AI agent could focus on the following improvements and additions:
User Interface for Configuration: Develop a simple web interface for non-technical users to configure AI prompts, email templates, and other parameters without needing to access the n8n workflow directly.
Dynamic Template Selection: Enable the AI to dynamically select from a library of email templates based on the detected category or intent of the input, providing more tailored responses.
Cost Monitoring: Add monitoring for API usage and costs, especially for AI model calls, to ensure cost-effectiveness.
